# stock-analysis
Repository for Module 2 (VBA) of Data Analytics
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was, foremost, to gain a working understanding of Visual Basic. To this end, a friend named Steve asks us to analyze a green stock that his parents are looking into, to see if it is a viable investment. Using VBA, I found the potential of the investment by finding the annual return and total daily volume. In addition, there were 11 stocks in total and each were analyzed to see their potential. Once this was done for each one, I was able to find the best stock and see the worth of investment into green stocks. There were various tools used to accomplish this, such as loops, reusing code, If-Then statements and static and conditional formatting.
